### Hi there 👋

I’m Obreja Adrian. Web designer from EU, with passion for new technologies. Love to work on front-end, make site design, building them and satisfied when pixels come to “life”. Also I love Drupal, that have a special place in my heart. Clean and minimalist web design, clean code and fast loading websites are three of my base principles. As a daily routine, I try to remain relevant in the technology industry: reading technical blogs, books and listening to a lot of podcasts.
